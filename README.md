Qt-Linguist
===========
Because tracking this sucker down is too hard, and so is building all of Qt.

Current version = 6.4.2

Windows releases only. Zip files contain linguist.exe, lconvert.exe, lrelease.exe, lrelease-pro.exe, lprodump.exe, lupdate.exe, and lupdate-pro.exe. Executables are static, 64-bit (starting with Qt 6.x), and built with MSVC 2022.
