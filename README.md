Qt-Linguist
===========

**Qt Linguist** is a string editing tool for Qt app translations that edits .ts files. This is a small tool included in the Qt development environment. But the full Qt is a installer of gigabytes. Since Qt is open source, so Qt Linguist standalone can be released.

Because tracking this sucker down is too hard, and so is building all of Qt.
